# Artificial-Neural-Network-ANN-Sequential-Model-to-predict-between-two-classes-on-Random-Data.

Created a random Data-Set .

Processed that DATA set to make it suitable as an input to sequential model.

Build ANN-Sequential model using KERAS integrated with Tensorflow.
Trained that Respective model.
Validated that modet on Subset of generated Data-Set.
Tested that particular model on Random Data-Set (generated-again).
Plotted Confusion-Matrix depicting efficiency of Respective Model.
